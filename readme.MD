# LangChain Q&A based on Subtitles

This Python program allows you to perform Q&A (Question and Answer) operations based on subtitles of videos. It utilizes LangChain, a library for natural language processing and understanding. With this program, you can extract relevant information from subtitles and interactively query it.

## Features

- **Q&A Operations**: Extracts data from subtitles to answer user queries.
- **Interactive Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for querying.
- **Flexible**: Supports various types of questions and subtitles in different languages.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- LangChain library
- Subtitle files in supported formats (e.g., .srt)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```
    pip install langchain
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Subtitles:**
    - Ensure your subtitle files are in a supported format (e.g., .srt).
  
2. **Run the Program:**
    ```
    python langchain_qna.py
    ```
   
3. **Interact with the Program:**
    - Enter your questions and the program will parse the subtitles to find relevant answers.

4. **Exit the Program:**
    - Type `exit` to quit the program.

## Supported Formats

- **Subtitle Formats**: .srt, .sub, .sbv, .vtt, etc.
- **Languages**: English, French, Spanish, German, etc.

## Example

Suppose you have a subtitle file named `video.srt`, and you want to ask questions about the content of the video:

1. Run the program: `python langchain_qna.py`
2. Enter your questions, such as:
    - "What is the main theme of the video?"
    - "Who is the protagonist?"
    - "When does the incident occur?"
3. Receive answers extracted from the subtitles.
